# PYT

PYT is a .NET command-line application that computes minimum jerk trajectories for an n-dimension coordinate space.

It was written to work with the ARNIE system (see [Spine](https://github.com/chrisalexander/Spine), my [libfreenect fork](https://github.com/chrisalexander/libfreenect)) and provide nice smooth human-like motion to the arm.

## Credits

The calculations performed in this program are based on mathematics by William Harwin at the University of Reading, based on some older historic work. A few modifications were made to make it work in practice.

## How did the name come about?
